What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    google docs saves all the data day by day and shows when we need that but as git is totally different from that it is manual and allow us to commit


Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    we can choose a size of commit in git but we can not choose it in google. We can commit multiple files in one go while on the other hand in google docs and others we can do this because there is not manual commit present there.


How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

     i can use git log and git diff to see the necessary code changes in my project
